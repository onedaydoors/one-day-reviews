  body: "Art is an act of creating. Of beauty. Through art, we have the chance to
    make something that has not of yet existed.\n\nI’ve realized that my best writing
    comes from the places of my most intense struggle. I will feel a certain way,
    be working through something, and the words will pour onto the paper. I've struggled
    reconciling intense creativity with normalcy. They have often been mutually exclusive.
    The times I feel like life is sailing along, I feel creatively stifled. \n\nDon’t
    get the wrong idea, these issues I work through are normal issues that people
    deal with. Only rarely have i ever dealt with huge, existential crisis’, but the
    one big time that I did, I wrote a whole show. The big catch for me has been finding
    how to write from a place of healing and wholeness without sacrificing the realness
    of what I’m creating, the depth of the thoughts, or the clarity of the vision
    that can come from difficulties.\n\nAnd, to an extent, I've figured it out.\n\nWhat
    I’m realizing is that intense creativity is not related to struggle itself. I’m
    inherently a creative person with a creative drive and passions. The reason I’ve
    felt most creative at the worst points of my life is because, in times of change,
    difficulty, and emotional turmoil, I lean the most heavily back into my passions.
    Writing grounds me, creativity grounds me, art grounds me, and the difficult times
    are when I feel the need to be grounded.\n\nThe way to maintain creativity in
    good times is to force inspiration as a result of discipline. True inspiration
    is so rare... the best artists make inspiration happen by constantly working at
    what they do, and their best work comes from that.\n\nKeep working at it."
