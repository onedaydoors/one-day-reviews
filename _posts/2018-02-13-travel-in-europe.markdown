  body: In 2015 and 2016 I had the chance to travel through Europe, working on creative
    projects. Seeing a different culture through a lens, I captured moments that,
    to me, summarize European culture in the best way I knew how. These images are
    a small glimpse into that world- my best attemp at capturing how Europe feels.
